### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm William Forte, an undergraduate engineering student based in New Jersey, USA.

What you can expect to see on my GitHub is a product of my current interests:

- Mechanical Engineering
- Robotics
- 3D Printing
- Web Development

I am currently conducting research in robotic design, simulation, and control.

(I am currently migrating from an old GitHub account so expect to see more on this one in the future!)
